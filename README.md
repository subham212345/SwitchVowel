# SwitchVowel
The goal of the project is to make the user provide a phrase as input and the output should be such that, each vowels will be replaced by the next vowel in English alphabet series and the consonants will stay the same. The output will keep the case(i.e. Lower or Upper) as provided by the user as well.
